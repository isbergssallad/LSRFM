Just aim at the subject, press the shutter button and the picture comes out of the camera. The Supercolor 635 comes with a built-in flash. The camera does not have a tripod socket. The Polaroid Supercolor 635 requires Polaroid 600 film. Currently, the Polaroid Color Film for 600 and the Polaroid B&W Film for 600 are the best choice. The battery for the instant camera and built-in flash is located in the film cassette, so it is renewed every time the film is changed.",
